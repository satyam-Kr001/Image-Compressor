# Image-Compressor
This project is based on Pyhton
This app is using PyQt5 as a GUI

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have used Huffman Encoding to convert Imgage into binary numbers and thus the Image get compressed.
Ater huffman encoding I have Implemented decoding part to get back the previous Image. 
Huffman coding a lossless compression technique.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In frontend part User can upload any Image from their Computer and then compress the Image.
Image will be compressed and generate a huffman encoded text file.
And this text file is used to decode the image back to its original size.......
